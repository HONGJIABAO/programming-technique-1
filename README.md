Learning C++ has been an exciting and challenging journey that has significantly contributed to my growth as a programmer.👨🏻‍💻At the beginning of my C++ journey,my problem-solving skills have improved due to build the pseudocode and flowchart.I was introduced to its syntax and basic constructs, such as variables, loops, and conditional statements. As I progressed, I explored more advanced concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP). Each topic presented its own challenges, but overcoming them gave me a great sense of accomplishment.Throughout this journey, I encountered several challenges, such as understanding complex syntax or troubleshooting runtime errors.🚀🚀🚀 However, these obstacles pushed me to find solutions independently, collaborate with peers which will strengthened my problem-solving abilities.In conclusion, learning C++ has been a transformative experience. It has not only equipped me with valuable technical skills but also improve discipline, logical thinking, and a passion for programming. I look forward to building on this foundation and using C++ to tackle more complex and exciting challenges in the future.✌🏻✌🏻🌟
